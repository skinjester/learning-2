YOU JUST MADE MENUS, RIGHT?
I made menu systems though. There were many possible journeys within the systems I created. And I saw those systems through from concept to implementation and was also responsible for fixing problems with the design when necessary. We evaluated and iterated on several ideas while balancing thematic elements, new technology, asset creation, art direction, screen design, animation, information architecture, content strategy and overal fun factor. There were false starts. We didn't make a concetual leap as a team until I began presenting content in-game, demonstrating methods of how to make the authoring system and game engine work together as a design tool. That was the creative work with the greatest impact. I also gave a team presentation describing my approach and conceptions of interface design and media in general, which I think was great self-promotion. people felt like they were dealing with an expert or at least a hacker. Even so - that design overwhelmed. My initual contribution was great, but I lost control of the visual design - or rather, handed that off to another designer. There was too much else going on in the technical and UX domains. If I could do it over again, I'd have handed off the technical work to a dedicated engineer and worked with them to figure out how to make things happen. I lost some confidence in my graphic design practice even as I gained major confidence in my ability to implement systems that worked.
